# On Campus Food Delivery System
 
This is a project that aims to aid students in ordering food and provide on-campus food delivery service by connecting multiple user roles such as cafeteria vendors, customers, delivery runners, and administrators. This application allows customers to order food from various vendors, choose dining options (dine-in, take-away, or delivery), and make payments through a credit-based system. Vendors receive and manage orders efficiently, while administrators handle user registrations and credit top-ups. Delivery runners are notified of tasks and can track their earnings. The system is developed using Object-oriented programming concepts and stores data in text files.
